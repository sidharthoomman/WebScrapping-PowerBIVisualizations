# WebScrapping-PowerBIVisualizations
If someone wants to get data from a webpage and put it on PowerBI Dashboard

Webscrapping is powerful to getting real time data off non-conventinal data sources. Examples lets say you want to track the Job Trends in the city of Toronto. Instead of manually going the different pages or jobboards, you can use a webscrapper to automatically download the data (data like Job title, location, descrptions etc) into a Excel or JSON format.

I used a tool called ParseHub. It is intutitive to use and has a good tutorial. 
Once this data is parsed, you can leveraeg PowerBI to analysze it. Here are the files I made on the same.
